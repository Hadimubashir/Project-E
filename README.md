# Kubernetes Cluster Creation and Management on AWS

Designed and deployed a scalable Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 with secure networking and high availability.

Tools: AWS EC2, Kubernetes (Kubeadm, Kubelet, Kubectl), Docker, Calico (CNI), Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Deployed a highly available Kubernetes cluster on AWS EC2 with one master node and two worker nodes.

2. Installed and configured Docker, Kubeadm, Kubelet, and Kubectl on all instances to set up the cluster.

3. Successfully initialized the master node and joined worker nodes to form a Kubernetes cluster.

4. Implemented Calico as the Container Network Interface (CNI) for pod-to-pod networking and network policy enforcement.

5. Verified cluster setup by listing worker nodes and ensuring connectivity within the cluster.
